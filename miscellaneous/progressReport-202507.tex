\subsection*{Work Done}

We submitted the paper titled \emph{Type-Checking for Pattern-Based Tree Transformations} for FSTTCS 2024. After it got rejected we planned to submit it to PODS 2026. For that, we added addressed all the reviewer comments received from the FSTTCS reviewers, added few examples with a database flavour to make the paper more readable and pertinent to PODS, and added comparisons with our work and some other models for tree transformations. We have submitted this work to PODS 2026 for review and are currently awaiting results.

I also worked on the tool which implements the algorithm for solving the \emph{Matching Problem} from our afore-mentioned paper. Currently the code is a bare-bones algorithm which accepts two trees and searches for an instance of the smaller tree in the larger tree.

I also commenced work on my thesis.

\subsection*{Future Plans}

I plan to work on the afore-mentioned paper submitted to PODS 2026 in terms of some improvements in quality of notation, proofs, and diagrams, and have it ready for submission to the second cycle along with changes requested by the reviewers.

I plan to complete and polish the tool to have it ready to solve the \emph{Matching Problem} in the special case of Abstract Syntax Trees(AST) generated by the Java compiler. The final aim would be to use it as an advanced version of search in ASTs that can can advantage of the tree structure and perform things like distinguishing between a variable named `foo' and a function named `foo', etc.

I am more or less on course to submit my thesis before August 2025, but would be grateful if given 3-4 months to complete the same as I feel that I will be able to then produce a version to my own satisfaction, which I can then submit.
